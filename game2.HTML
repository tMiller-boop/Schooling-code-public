            to make because i had a retro text based game in mind but this was the closest i could get too given the perameters-->
            You feel around on the ground but only feel rocks and the cold damp floor, You hear something move in the distance!<br/>
            <!-- the fabled buttons again, they have been the highlight of the forfront to much of my difficulty as of late, but once i figure out 
             the proper way of getting them to work things will go much more smoothly.-->

        <!--this is the breaking poing of the original story, the concept was having the extra text being hidden so at "start" if they chose either
        (A) or (B) the "light&weapon" text would appear while the "sleep" text would remain hidden, since that choice is no longer available all choices
        based off it will also be gone. at least thats the overall plan for it.-->

            you try to make yourself comfortable on the COLD and DAMP floor! You even grab the biggest, softest looking ROCK <br>
        to rest your dreary head upon to get a little nappy time in.<br/>
        <br/><!--see i pay attention. using the br/ to seperate the sentances and giving the letters some space in between-->
        As you begin to get comfortable the sounds around you begin to get louder!<br/>
        "rocks falling in the distance"<br/>
         <!--another choice base where i made the slight notion to look for a light source or weapon
          that most survival based games make you look for or craft-->

    <!--YES!! this is my favorate section in this game, the choice you make for your rock! 
    is it a pointless task...yes
    is it important to the main game... no
    is it a fun and creative way you use code to generate the name you choose to be incorperated in the text [name] in the next section...
    well if i can get it to work then...yes-->
        <h4 id="rock" style="display: none;">

            You look around and found more wet rocks.<br/>
                You decided to name one. Why? I don't know? As it stated<br/>
                 "You decided to name one." So what is its name:<br/>
                 <!-- i loved the name ideas. i chose wilson because of castaway, teddy because alot of horror games have a teddy bear
                  and nothing because either way its getting a name even if you name it nothing-->

            After carefully carving [name] into the rock you place [name] in your pocket<br/>
        rassuring [name] that you'll get it out safely, you love [name] and wish to save [name]. you begin<br/>

            Your investigation of the sound brought you to a cave-in.<br/>
            you look closely and see a faint light coming from behind the rocks<br/>
            you feel a cool breeze:<br/>

            You yell as loud as you can asking for help! Nobody "outside" heard you...<br/>

        but then what. you get the same ending-->
        <h8 id="hole" style="display: none;"> 
            You manage to get a bunch of rocks out of a corner of the cave-in enterance,<br/>
            It looks like enough room to crawl out!<br/>

            You escaped the cave! Congratulations you were able to escape!<br/>

        </h9>
        <!--the ending i want-->
        <h10 id="home" style="display: none;">
            You cleared the rest of the cave-in as well as went to the store near by<br/>
            and bought alot of cleaning equipment, generator, lumber, power tools,and invested<br/>
            your life savings into the cave. it looks really nice now.<br/>
            You even built a shelf where you have now named many other rocks<br/>
            You are now at peace in the cave... For now.<br/>
            <br/>
            <!--see an amazing ending, the ending all champions go for, and the ending i will allways go for!-->
